Hypothesis 1: Some people will check the next tab for significant discounts, but not care about a minor increase

Hypothesis 2: Some people never scroll to the next page looking for better discounts, thus setting up the front page a particular way is important

Hypothesis 3: Some people don't even scroll through the list, meaning the top 14 items only show.
